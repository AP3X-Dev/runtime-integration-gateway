# rig-bridge-mcp

Stub implementation for RIG Bridge for MCP.

This repo does not vendor an MCP server library. The bridge will be completed once an MCP protocol library is selected.

Target behavior:
- Export tools from RIG Registry
- Route tool calls through RIG Runtime
- Preserve policy and approvals
